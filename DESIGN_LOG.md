# Design & Development Log
*Yilin Geng Portfolio Website*

## Current State (Initial Session - July 25, 2025)

### Visual Design Philosophy
- **Andy Warhol Pop Art Aesthetic**: Bold, high-contrast colors with electric pink (#ff1493), bright yellow (#ffff00), electric blue (#00bfff), and lime green (#00ff00)
- **Typography**: Bold Helvetica Neue with heavy font weights (800-900), uppercase text, and distinctive letter spacing
- **Layout**: Geometric, grid-based structure with intentional rotation transforms and dramatic box shadows
- **Interactive Elements**: Transform-based hover effects, animated gradients, and pop art-inspired color transitions

### Key Design Elements

#### Navigation
- Fixed black header with electric pink border
- Yellow brand text with pink text shadow
- Hover effects with blue background and scale transforms

#### Hero Section
- Black background with animated Warhol gradient
- Massive title with layered color shadows (pink/blue/yellow)
- Rotating subtitle badges in signature colors
- 2x2 portrait grid with "YG" initials in pop art style

#### Content Sections
- White backgrounds with thick black borders
- Alternating directional box shadows in signature colors
- Rotating card transforms (-1deg to 2deg variations)
- Bold section titles with gradient underlines

#### Color System
```css
--electric-pink: #ff1493    # Primary brand color
--bright-yellow: #ffff00    # Secondary accent
--electric-blue: #00bfff    # Cool accent
--lime-green: #00ff00       # Fresh accent
--hot-orange: #ff4500       # Energy accent
--purple-pop: #8a2be2       # Creative accent
```

### Technical Approach
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Transform-based animations
- Content-based architecture with JSON data
- Mobile-responsive design with collapsing navigation

### Current Pages Status
- ✅ **Home**: Complete hero and navigation
- ✅ **About**: Warhol grid philosophy sections
- ✅ **Portfolio**: Tabbed content with color-coded categories
- ✅ **Photography**: Philosophy cards and album showcases
- ✅ **Projects**: Interactive project cards with preview states
- ✅ **Contact**: Multi-method contact grid

## Design Principles to Maintain

1. **Bold Visual Impact**: Every element should have strong visual presence
2. **Consistent Color Harmony**: Stick to the established pop art palette
3. **Playful Interactions**: Transform-based hover effects and rotations
4. **Typography Hierarchy**: Heavy weights, uppercase, generous letter spacing
5. **Geometric Structure**: Grid-based layouts with intentional asymmetry
6. **Content-First**: JSON-driven content for easy updates

## Future Considerations
- Animation refinements and micro-interactions
- Content expansion and new project additions
- Performance optimization for complex transforms
- Accessibility improvements while maintaining visual impact
