Hi! I'm a PhD student in NLP at Melbourne, exploring instruction hierarchy and chain of command structures in AI systems - basically, how language models handle authority and follow orders.

I also co-founded **LibrAI** (working with many much smarter people). It's a fast-growing startup transforming enterprise operations through cutting-edge AI. We build and deploy agentic systems that drive efficiency and innovation. I'm also President of the AI Group at UniMelb, connecting researchers with industry opportunities across Australia's AI ecosystem. 

My path here has been wonderfully chaotic - investment analysis, product management, now AI research & product. I believe technology should spark joy, not just optimize everything to death.
